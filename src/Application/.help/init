The <info>git pr %command.name%</info> command creates/updates a configuration
file (e.g <comment>.git-pull-request.yml</comment>).

It can generate 1 out of 3 configuration files:
* <info><HOME>/.git-pull-request.yml</info>
        can store global information such as the default credentials
        for all your provider (Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab)
* <info><WORKING_DIR>/.git-pull-request.yml</info>
        can store generic information about your repository:
        - its full-name
        - the provider to use
        - the way we can detect if a pull request is a PATCH, MINOR or MAJOR version
        - ...
        This file should be shared across the team
* <info><WORKING_DIR>/.git/.git-pull-request.yml</info>
        can store your credentials to connect to the current repository's provider.
        It may also override information stored in the <comment>shared</comment> file but it is not recommended.
